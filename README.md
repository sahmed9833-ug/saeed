# Personal website & Portfolio showcase

A fairly simple website/portfolio, because every developer should have one.

This project uses:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Svelte Routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing)
- [svelte-media-query](https://github.com/xelaok/svelte-media-query)
- [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS)
- [RxFire](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk)

...and that's about it. With how simple this website is I probably could have saved myself a lot of time and pain by building it in [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), or I could have used [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for the styling, but where's the fun in that?
