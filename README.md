# Personal website & Portfolio showcase

A fairly simply website/blog/portfoilio, because every developer has to have one. This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

This project uses:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [svelte-routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing)
- [svelte-media-query](https://github.com/xelaok/svelte-media-query)
